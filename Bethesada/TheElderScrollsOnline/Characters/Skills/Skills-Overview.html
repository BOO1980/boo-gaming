    <h1>Skills</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>In Elder Scrolls online, you advance your character by using different abilities, granted to yo through
            different skills lines.</li>
        <li>In order to increase your progressuon in a skill line you must use those sjills</li>
        <li>There are three types of skills: Passive skills, active skills, and ultimate skills</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Passive Skills</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide a bonus all the time</li>
        <li>Some require certain items to be equipped or Active Skills to be slotted but otherwise you don't need to
            think about them</li>
        <li>They generally have a number of upgrades available which can be acquired by increasing your level in the
            relevant skills line</li>
        <li>In most cases, this is achieved by using the Active Skill within the same skill line</li>
        <li>In other cases, such as crafting skills, this can be achieved by crafting items or research</li>
        <li>Each upgrade costs and additional skills points</li>
        <li>Some Passive Skills do not require an investments of skill points but instead provided free as a result of
            certain situations</li>
        <li>For example, each race gets one free passive which increases their experience gain with a given skill</li>
    </ul>
