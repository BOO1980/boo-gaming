    <ul>
        <li>
            Aldmeri Exile's Sword, damage: 1037: level 1, description: A peerless example of Elvin smithing. With the

    </ul>
    <h2>Bows</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Aldmeri Exile's Bow, damage: 1013: level 1, The ages wood of this bow creaks with every draw, but it aim
            remains true.

    <h2>Axes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Aldmeri Exile's GreatAxe, damage: 1192: level 1, While it may not be as sharp as it once was, the Elven

    </ul>
    <h2>Restoration Staff</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Aldmeri Exile's Resoratuon Staff, damage: 965: level 1, Soothing energy leaks from the cracks and whorls of

    <h2>Shields</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Aldmeri Exile's Shield, damage: 1340: level 1, The ravages of time may have tarnished this aegis, but it
